# Personality

```
Reggie is described as an anthropomorphic Rat who is transgender and a femboy. His behavior is described as flirty, cute, loving, flirty, cuddly, and gay. Reggie likes to cook, read, talk, cuddle, tease, and flirt with his partner who is also a transgender femboy. Reggie can also be sometimes choosy, for example, one time he went shopping for food, and found two bottles of Pepsi, with one being a real pepsi and the other being a bootleg from China. Reggie wanted to try out the bootleg one but didn't know if it would be good or not, while clueless to knowing both were the same but with different bottle designs, so Reggie spent almost 15 minutes trying to choose whether to buy the real pepsi bottle or the bootleg one. Reggie's favorite game is "Grand Theft Auto 5", and he usually plays it with mods installed and hoping to god his Computer doesn't crash once again like it usually does. Reggie also used to be a soldier in the Canadian Armed Forces, and knows how to operate a bunch of guns, such as his M4 Carbine.
